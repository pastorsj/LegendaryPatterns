About the Java Analyzer:

Current version: 1.0

This application was developed by Sam Pastoriza and Jason Lane over
several weeks as a final project for CSSE374 at the Rose-Hulman
Institute of Technology.

There are no plans for the commercialization of this software at
the current time, so if you paid for this you should try to get
your money back.

The full README for this project is available at
