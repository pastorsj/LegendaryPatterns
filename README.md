## Overall Design


## How to use the code
Open DesignParser.java in an editor, probably Eclipse  
Add class names (including package) to the static "classes" String array*  
Run DesignParser, where a text.dot file is created in the input_output folder  
Run graphviz (such as via dot.exe or gvedit.exe) on the .dot file
